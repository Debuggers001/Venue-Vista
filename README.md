# Venue-Vista
Venue Vista Website is a web application that simplifies the process of finding the perfect location for your events, whether it's a birthday party, a corporate meeting, or any other gathering. This project leverages various Google Maps APIs to provide users with location suggestions, event analysis, and directions to their chosen destination.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration:** The website seamlessly integrates with Google Maps, providing users with an interface that resembles the popular mapping service. Users can search for locations, get directions, and view maps directly on the site.

- **Event Details:** Users can input event details such as the event type (e.g., birthday party, meeting), the number of attendees, and the event date.

- **Location Search:** The website uses the Google Places API to search for locations based on the event type and size, providing users with a list of suitable venues.

- **Directions:** The Google Directions API is used to calculate directions from the user's location to the selected venue, making it easy for users to plan their journey.

- **Event Recommendations:** Based on the event details and location search, the website can provide event recommendations, taking into account factors like venue availability and proximity.

- **Time Zone Information:** The Google Maps Time Zone API is used to provide users with time-related information about the selected location.
